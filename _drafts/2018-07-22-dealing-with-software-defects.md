The goal of the IdSpace project is to create tooling for collaborative, distributed product innovation. This means that distributed teams would no longer be hindered by not being present at a single location to do creative work together. Using an innovation process of several phases, a team uses the on line tools to interact with each other.

Pieter was responsible for the development of *Liferay portlets*, which are the scaffolding on which the platform is build. He was also one of the developers of the shared canvas, which allows a distributed team to simultaneously draw in real time. Although nowadays various commercial implementations of such a shared canvas exist, IdSpace was the first platform to offer this feature.
