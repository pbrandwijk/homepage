A requirement specification is a document shared between the developer and the product owner. Different methodologies use different names and formats for this document (`user story`, `contract`, `requirement`, etc) but in its essence it is an agreement between the one making the software and the one in charge of what it needs to do.

## Who uses a requirement specification
The requirement specification should be used throughout the development process: definition (obviously), construction and evaluation. This means that the three essential roles that deal with the document are the product owner, the developer and the tester. We will go over them one by one.

### Product owner
The product owner has both the opportunity and the duty to create a complete and unambiguous specification of what the software needs to do and the conditions it needs to comply to. A duty, because this is one of the toughest jobs in software engineering. An opportunity, because once done, the effort pays itself back many times.

A good specification will dramatically increase the likelihood that the software functions as intended. And if it doesn't, the specification defines what the intention is, or what you thought that the intention was. With a high quality requirement specification, there are only two possible reasons why software does not function correctly:
* The software does not comply to the specification. This you can check with the requirement.
* The specification does not describe the actual desired behavior and conditions. In this case you have to revise the requirement specification.

If you do not have a high quality requirement specification, there is a third possible reason why software does not function correctly. Countless development projects have failed because of this and innumerable hours and unimaginable sums of money have been wasted due to it:
* The specification does not fully define what the desired behavior and conditions are, leaving everybody, including yourself, guessing.

In this last case, what needs fixing first is your requirement specification. Try to fix the software first and you're in for a lot of headache.

### Developer
Developers obviously use the requirement specification to implement the software. This alone is reason enough why the specification should be as clear as possible. But other than that, the requirement document gives structure to the code base. Changes that functionally go together can be traced if the requirements are set up well. This is also why it is so important to link each commit to version control to a specification.
