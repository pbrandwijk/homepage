*The command line program `chronorder` is written for Unix-like operating systems. It is a small utility for renaming files. Its default behavior is to rename files so that the alphabetical order matches the chronological order. To do this, an index number is prepended to every file, starting at "1" for the oldest file in the directory.*

The use case for the program is a collection of files gathered from different sources, where each source has a different naming convention. For example, pictures that were taken by different cameras on a holiday. Making the alphabetical order match the chronological order assures that the files are neatly sorted when they are displayed in a file manager.

## Download and installation

The sources of `chronorder` can be downloaded from [GitHub](http://github.com/pbrandwijk/chronorder). A guide for compilation and installation is included. `man` pages explain the various options that are available.

Additionally, you can download a Debian installation package below. The package is compiled for 64 bits Debian-based distributions of Linux, including Ubuntu.

<span class="debian-package"></span><span class="package-name">[chronorder_1.0-1_amd64.deb]({{ "/assets/chronorder_1.0-1_amd64.deb" | prepend: site.baseurl }})</span>

## Quick start

Here the basic usage of `chronorder` is explained. It is assumed that you know how to operate the terminal and that the `chronorder` executable is available on your path. The terminal examples are based on the standard Ubuntu `bash` shell.

### Basic usage

Suppose you have a directory `~/Pictures` containing pictures taken by two different cameras. The cameras use a different naming convention, which resulted in the following directory listing:

```shell
pieter@ubuntu:~/Pictures$ ls -ls | awk '{print $7,$8,$9}'
2013-03-07 10:56 CIMG8934.JPEG
2013-03-07 12:45 CIMG8935.JPEG
2013-03-07 13:12 CIMG8936.JPEG
2013-03-07 10:13 IMG_2967.jpg
2013-03-07 11:24 IMG_2968.jpg
2013-03-07 13:09 IMG_2969.jpg
```

All of these files are timestamped on March 7, but all at a different time of the day. Because of the alphabetical ordering on the file names it is difficult to see the chronological order. An excellent use case for the following command:

```shell
pieter@ubuntu:~/Pictures$ chronorder
```

You are now prompted with the safety question. Press 's' to preview the results of the renaming. Then press 'y' to confirm the changes, or 'n' to abort the program without applying the changes. If you chose to confirm, the directory listing will now look like this:

```shell
pieter@ubuntu:~/Pictures$ ls -ls | awk '{print $7,$8,$9}'
2013-03-07 10:13 1_IMG_2967.jpg
2013-03-07 10:56 2_CIMG8934.JPEG
2013-03-07 11:24 3_IMG_2968.jpg
2013-03-07 12:45 4_CIMG8935.JPEG
2013-03-07 13:09 5_IMG_2969.jpg
2013-03-07 13:12 6_CIMG8936.JPEG
```

### Getting help

For an overview of the various options of `chronorder` you can refer to the `man` page of the program:

```shell
pieter@ubuntu:~$ man chronorder
```

A more condensed version of the options can also be obtained with the following command:

```shell
pieter@ubuntu:~$ chronorder -?
```
