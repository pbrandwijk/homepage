Using a shared account that every one can use may seem like a good idea. After all, you don't have to go through the hassle of setting up and managing separate accounts for everyone. Also, you save yourself and the team from a lot of permission errors when times are though and you are willing to compromise basic security for speed of action. But beware! There is a price to pay when more than one person uses the same account.

That price is (ironically) accountability. With multiple people using the same account there is just no telling anymore who did what.
