Every serious development project needs some sort of version control. Popular options today include `git`, `mercurial`, `bazar` and `svn`. Each of these systems works a bit differently, but all of them have the concept of a 'commit' in common.

## What is a commit?
Committing something to version control means that you have made some changes to your code and want to save these changes as a new version. Also, you want to be able to go back at anytime to the version of your code as it was before your commit. And likewise you want to be able to reproduce the current version of your code in the future, when possibly many other version have succeeded it. All this you achieve by committing code to your version control system.
