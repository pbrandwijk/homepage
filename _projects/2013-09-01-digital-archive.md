The goal of the Digital Archive is offering an institute wide repository for storing and retrieving documents that are created during forensic investigation. Such a repository did not exist previously and the institute relied on paper files which were difficult to access and transfer.

The system is developed on the Nuxeo ECM platform, using Java as programming language. Pieterâ€™s responsibilities were implementing SCRUM user stories and solving reported findings from the test, acceptation and production servers. Furthermore, he was responsible for optimizing the PostgreSQL database in order to improve performance.

The Digital Archive is used at this moment by one department of the NFI. During the second half of 2013 the application will be rolled out to the rest of the institute.
