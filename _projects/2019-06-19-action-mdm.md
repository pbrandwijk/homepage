This client is a fast growing retailer which is rapidly expanding business in Europe. To manage their master data, they are implementing Stibo Step as their MDM solution. I joined this project after two years into its implementation and took on the role of Lead developer.

## Project in short
- MDM solution based on Stibo Step
- Agile project using scrum
- Project team of about 15 people
- Development team of 7 people
- Around 25.000 products
- 7 countries
- 5 languages

## Accomplishments
- The establishment of standard form of describing the system requirements, first and foremost by defining the acceptance criteria of each user story.
- The introduction of version control based on git. This also includes a code review process based on pull requests
- The introduction of a structured deployment plan and performing a test run of this plan before the actual deployment. This greatly reduced the amount of incidents on production due to deployment errors
- The creation of open source tooling to assist various development tasks
- The creation of a development framework to develop and unit test the business rules created for the system
- The setting up of a fully automated regression test set
- Establishing clear development guidelines so that development is done more uniformly and uses best practices

## Utilities
For this project I set up a general framework for the development and testing of JavaScript files. You can find this framework on my GitHub page as project [Vality][vality].

I also created a utility application to quickly transform an XML document based on a custom XSLT. This utility you can find on my GitHub page as project [Emary][emary].
