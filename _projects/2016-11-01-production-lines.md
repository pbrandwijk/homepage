Production Lines is a multinational service of Capgemini. Its objective is to create a uniform production line (also known as Platform as a Service, or PaaS) between all units and operating countries of Capgemini. The service offers a platform where the projects of the company can be managed from a single on-line interface. Besides that, Production Lines adds value by offering high flexibility between projects to assemble their production environment the way they want.

Pieter worked as architect on this service. Production Lines superseded various other legacy services of the *Shared Services* department and Pieter redesigned the service to make use of modern technologies like Docker and Git. He was also responsible for the training of the service team in India and Morocco and the communication and promotion of the service within Capgemini international.

Production Lines was launched in 2016. Ever since its start the number of projects that rely on the service to create and manage their environment is rapidly increasing. It is heading steady towards its goal of becoming Capgemini's standard environment for development projects.
