The Kamala platform offers a generic platform for Knowledge Technology and the semantic web. I does this by implementing linked data in the form of [Topic Maps](http://www.topicmaps.org/). It can connect content from various sources and create a seamless integration of data. Furthermore it can query the data to find new connections between content.

Pieter was responsible from the implementation of the analytical module to query the data and find new relations. The system has been applied to a diverse range of use cases. It has shown to be an adaptable system that adds value by integrating and enriching content.
