The goal of the Marketing Content Management (MCM) project is to speed up and improve the product marketing process of Philips globally. This process involves the management of technical product data, the translations of marketing texts for all Philips target languages, the maintenance of product assets like pictures and photo-metric measurements and presenting the content on the Philips website, leaflets and manuals. It is of vital importance to Philipsâ€™ marketing strategy to significantly decrease the throughput time of this process from the three months which it currently takes.

Pieter worked as lead developer and technical lead in this agile project in various SCRUM teams. He gave guidance to junior developers in the creation of software components for the system. He developed a crucial transformer system for delivering messages from the MCM system to the various output channels. Pieter also used his knowledge of formal methods to create solution designs for the various business rules in the system.

The MCM system will go live in March 2015. It will then entirely replace the old system. From the acceptance tests of the system it has become clear that users are very satisfied with the speed of the system and its improvements. They are looking forward to the moment of go-live.
