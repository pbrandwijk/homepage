The goal of the IPK project is to connect and combine sources from various repositories into one seamless information landscape. These sources include the content generated as part of the parliamentary process, like proceedings, motions and amendments, and also content that assists members of parliament to gather information on a subject.

The project is based on the principles of linked data using the [Topic Maps ISO standard](http://www.topicmaps.org/). Pieter was responsible for developing the interface and data extraction modules. The engine used to create unique identifiers for the content is [Ontopia](https://github.com/ontopia).

The IPK project allowed people to consult a single interface for all parliamentary content instead of the multitude of systems that had to be consulted previously. It also combined information on the same subject from different sources, giving the user a compete view of the content. The system has been taken in as part of a complete data warehouse for Dutch parliamentary information.
