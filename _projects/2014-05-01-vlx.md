The goal of the VLx project is to equip the German publishing house MVB with a fully integrated system for the maintenance of digital assets like ebooks and audio books. The users of this system are both publishers, who deliver assets, and the on-line selling channels like Apple and Amazon.

Pieter worked on this project as technical lead, developing an Enterprise Content Management solution based on Nuxeo ECM. Pieter was responsible for the guidance and task distribution of the junior developers on the project. He also developed various components of the system, like the data migration module. This module allows existing data to be transformed in the new structure, to be connected to other applications and to allow the throughput of assets and meta-data.

The project has been delivered to great satisfaction of the client. The ECM solution is part of a large landscape of new applications. The full VLx project will be delivered in the course of 2014.
